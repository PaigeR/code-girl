How to make changes:
1) If you make changes to any .soy file (most of the webpage structure is contained in this), you need to remake the folder by typing "make name-en" where name is the name of the folder [ex. make puzzle-en]
2) If you make changes to a .js file or .css file, just reload the browser and the changes should be visible
